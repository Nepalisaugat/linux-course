Should tear wear a helmet
# Threat Model 
Threat modeling means looking at a system to find security or privacy risks before they become issues.
we can do it by asking four questions: what are we working on,what can go wrong,What are we going to do about it,and did we do a good enough job.
it's not just for security experts it's for anyone who cares about system saftey.it also emphasizes values like fixing real problem ,working together over rigid tools,doing the work instead of just planning it,and 
always refining instead of treating it as done.
My thought: It’s more about how you think than about following a strict method.


# Shostack 2022- world's shortest threat modelling course
A short set of lessons (About 15 min total) that explain the basics.
Uses STRIDE(Spooning,Tampering.Repudiation,info disclosure,Dos,Elevation of privilege) to think about threats.
Shows how data flow diagrams help visualize where problems might show up.
The overall vibe is don't overcomplicate this, you can start small.
MY thought: This one made me fell like threat modeling is approachable.

# OWASP CheatSheets Series Team 2021
Practical reference with steps for scoping, modeling, and prioritizing.
Lists different approaches (STRIDE, CIA, attack trees, etc.).
Helps connect the theory into something you can actually do.
My thought: I’d probably keep this open while working on a real project.

# Darknet Diaries Episode
I picked episode 55,The Beirut Bank Job.
Hackers targeted lebanese banks and pulled off fraudulent transfers.
Geopolitical and financial instability made the banks more attractive targets.
showed how money motivates attackers and how weak system can be exploited.
lesson: financial institutions should basically assume they’re always being watched by attackers.

# Security Hygiene
Some basic practices everyone (individuals and companies) should follow:
Use strong, unique passwords with a password manager.
Enable two-factor authentication everywhere it’s offered.
Keep operating systems and applications updated.
Regular backups, and actually test restoring them.
Encrypt sensitive data, both in transit and at rest.
Least-privilege access (employees only get the access they need).
Be cautious with phishing emails and links.
Monitor logs and set up alerts for suspicious behavior.

Make-belief boogie-man - a threat model for imaginary company.
Company Meditrack
It is a small SaaS startup provides an onlinr health record platform for private clinics.Doctors use it to store patient info and share lab results securely with patients.
What are we working on
# Assets (what's Valuable)
 Patient health records(Crown Jewels)
 Authentication system (doctor's and patients accounts)
 Billing data (credit card details, invoices)
 company reputation
# key systems
 web app (main portas for clinics + patients)
 Backend API
 Database with sensitive health info
 Third party payment processor
# customer touchpoints
 login via website and mobile app
 customer support portal
 Email notification 

# Diagram
patient/Doctor - web/Mobile App - API- Database - payment Gateway

# What can go wrong 
spoofing: Attacker fakes login page - steals doctor credentials
Tampering: someone modifies lab results in the database 
Info disclouser: Database breach leaks patient health data 
Denial of service: Attackers flood the system, clinics can't access records

# Biggest risks 
patient data breach
service outage

# Threat actors 
Cybercriminals motivated by selling health records.
Maybe hacktivists if the company is seen as unethical.

# What are we going to do about it?
Mitigate 
MFA for all accounts
Encrypt health records at rest and in transit
Regular backups and offline copies for ransomware recovery

Eliminate 
Don't store card numbers locally
Disable unused admin accounts

Transfer
Buy cyber insurance
Legal contracts with hosting provider to ensure uptime gurantees

Accept
Minor risks like spam through the support portral

# Did we do good Enough
Schedule regular security audits and pentests
keep software updated
continuous threat modeling sessions every time we add new features
Monitor logs and add instructions detection
