#Read and Summarize
Hutchins et al. 2011 - Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defence Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains
#Abstract :
Traditional defences focus too much on single alerts or malware signatures.
A better approach is to look at campaigns over time: how attackers operate, not just what they send.
The “intrusion kill chain” model explains cyberattacks in phases (like military kill chain).
Understanding each phase allows defenders to detect, deny, disrupt, or degrade attacks earlier.

#Intrusion Kill Chain:
Seven stages: Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command & Control, and Actions on Objectives.
Every stage gives defenders a chance to break the chain.
Even if attackers succeed in one step, defenders can still block later stages.
The model shifts thinking from isolated incidents to adversary campaigns.

#My comment/question:
The model is linear, but modern attacks can loop back (e.g., repeated recon or new malware delivery). 
How do defenders adapt when attackers don’t follow the “straight line” chain?

#Tactics, Tools and Procedures (MITRE ATT&CK context)
Tactic (definition + example):
A tactic is the adversary’s goal or reason for an action the “why”.
Example: Credential Access (goal = stealing passwords, keys, or tokens).
Technique (definition + example):
A technique is how the goal is achieved.
Example: Brute Force (ATT&CK T1110) trying many passwords until one works.
Subtechnique (definition + example):
A subtechnique breaks a technique into a more specific method.
Example: Password Guessing (T1110.001) manually or automatically guessing common passwords.
Procedure:
A procedure is a real world implementation of a technique/sub technique by an actual adversary.
Example: Using the tool Hydra to automate password guessing on SSH.

#Voluntary Bonus: Attack Story
Attack scenario (simplified):
1.Reconnaissance (T1592 Gather Victim Host Information) - Attacker scans the company’s web server with Nmap.
2.Initial Access (T1190 Exploit Public-Facing Application) -Exploits a vulnerable WordPress plugin to upload a web shell.
3.Execution (T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter) - Runs commands through the web shell using PHP.
4.Persistence (T1505.003 Web Shell) - Installs a hidden PHP backdoor for re-entry.
5.Credential Access (T1003 OS Credential Dumping) -Uses mimikatz to dump cached Windows credentials.
6.Defence Evasion (T1070 Indicator Removal) - Deletes logs to hide traces.
7.Exfiltration (T1041 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) - Sends stolen passwords to attacker’s server via HTTPS.
Defensive actions:
IDS alerts on abnormal PHP traffic (C2 channel).
SOC analyst detects log deletion attempt.
Access is cut, and web shell is quarantined.
Outcome: Attack stopped before data could be misused
